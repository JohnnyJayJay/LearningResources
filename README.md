# LearningResources
Crowd-sourced collation of resources for learning programming


## What this is 

This repository contains a crowd-sourced compendium of curated links for learning
various programming topics. Anyone is free to contribute, or use this data at no cost 
(although credit is appreciated).

The links are stored in a machine readable format (JSON) with a clearly defined schema,
and we run a CDN that can be used to fetch the most up to date versions of the data at any point,
complete with JSON indexing.

This can be accessed at https://developerden.net/learning-resources

## How to contribute

Simply make a PR and submit it!

### Guidelines
- Keep the pros and cons section as objective as possible
- Prices should be in US Dollars (eg `19.99`)
- Keep the descriptions for topics concise
- For more abstract concepts, try and keep them generic rather than for a specific language.
For example, "Dependency Injection" rather than "Dependency Injection in Java". You can then include
more specific resources
- Name JSON files in `lower_snake_case`
